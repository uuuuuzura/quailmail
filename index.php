      <p>
        My name is <strong>Quails</strong>, or <strong>Donovan</strong>.
      </p>
      <p>
        I originally launched <strong>quailmail.moe</strong> in 2022 with
        the intention of using it as a hub for various side projects
        which... never happened. Several years later I decided to
        repurpose the domain as my central hub on the internet.
